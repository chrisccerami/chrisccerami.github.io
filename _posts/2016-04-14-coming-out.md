# So here's the thing...

In the last couple years I've gotten to this really great point in my life. I love the city I live in, I love my job and my new career, and I love all of my friends between Boston, New Jersey, and wherever else they may live. With how great everything has been going, there was something I was still fundamentally unhappy about, so this past summer I decided to start taking steps to make that better.

Since I was young, around 13 or 14, I knew that I liked both boys and girls. For those of you who I haven't told yet, that's right; I'm ðŸŒˆnot straightðŸŒˆ. I told almost no one for 15 years, and I dreaded anyone finding out for just as long. This summer I started telling some of my close friends, which was made a lot easier now that I have a lot of LGBTQ+ friends to share it with.

For everyone else that is finding out now, consider this my official coming out. The reasons I'm writing this all down is:

- I'm awkward and talking about this is still awkward for me (and possibly you!)
- I knew a lot of people would have questions, and this would make it easier to answer them all at once.

Here are some answers to questions I've gotten from people already, and others that I anticipate people asking.

### So you're gay?

No, not every man who likes men is gay, although I understand your confusion. I like people of multiple genders.

### What do I call you?

Chris, typically.

If you mean what adjectives can you use to describe my orientation though, I personally prefer `queer`, but `bisexual` and `pansexual` are also totally fine.

### What do those words mean, exactly?

Well, that's a complicated question. They mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people. Here's what they mean to me, though:

`queer`: Anyone who falls anywhere in the LGBTQ+ spectrum. For me personally, I use it to mean pretty much the same as pansexual.

`pansexual`: Someone who is attracted to people of all (or at least many) genders.

`bisexual`: Someone who is attracted to both men and women.

### What do you mean by all genders? There's not just men and women?

Correct. The way I, and many other people, see it is that gender is a spectrum, and people can fall anywhere (or nowhere) along that spectrum. Many people feel perfectly comfortable with the gender they are assigned at birth: male or female.

Other people feel that they are more comfortable with the opposite gender from the one which they were assigned at birth; that's called being `transgender`.

Yet other people don't feel comfortable in either of those boxes and feel somewhere in between, or that they shift between the two; the terms `genderfluid` and `genderqueer` tend to be well suited for these people.

Still other people feel that they don't feel comfortable with any gender identity and prefer to identify as `agender`, meaning without gender.

I personally think all of those people are pretty cool and I don't typically take gender into account when I decide who I'm interested in romantically.

### Isn't "queer" a slur?

This can be a tricky topic. For people of a certain generation, they've probably only heard the word "queer" used in a derogatory sense. Even now, calling someone "a queer" is generally negative, and not appreciated. Calling someone "a queer", as a noun, is a lot like calling someone a "homo", and isn't very nice.

When someone identifies themself as "queer" however, as an adjective, it's usually used as an inclusive way to say that they are somewhere in the LGBTQ+ spectrum but without needing all those letters.

To sum it up, "Chris is queer" or "Chris is a queer dude" is totally cool and accurate. On the other hand, "Chris is a queer" is not cool.

## This doesn't change anything about me

For anyone who is reading this and wondering, "When did this happen?", or "Seeing Chris is going to be so weird now.", keep in mind that I have felt this way for my entire life and you just haven't known about it. I'm still the same person, so if you didn't like me before, you still won't, and if we got along before, we probably still will.

This is just something that I __really__ needed to get off my chest. If you have questions or want to talk to me about this, please feel free, that's totally cool. If you feel weird about it and don't want to bring it up, that's also cool, we can just go on totally ignoring the fact that I like boys. This got a little more serious than I intended, but really so far everyone that I've told has been awesome and supportive and I love all of ya. If you read this whole thing, then seriously thank you, that's pretty cool of you.
